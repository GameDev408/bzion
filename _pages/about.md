BZiON is a modern and well-built League Management System (LMS) designed for BZFlag leagues as a replacement for the bz-owl project.

This platform is designed with other developers in mind -- anyone can easily and quickly build on top of the platform or build their own service that uses this API without the need of site owner to modify several configuration files or making manual calls to the database. All of our APIs will always be backwards compatible for a specified amount of time; don't worry we won't break your code with our updates! We'll even help you upate your code to a newer API if necessary.
