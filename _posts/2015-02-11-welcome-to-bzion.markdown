After several delays in release dates, the initial release of BZiON is planned for late-March 2015 with the release name of "Met the Deadline." BZiON was built with the sole reason of continuing where bz-owl left off and because of that, we'd like to hear your suggestions on what you would like to improve. The latest build of BZiON is hosted by tw1sted and can always be found on the [BZPro website](http://bzion.bzpro.net/dev.php) if you would like to see our progress or what it looks like.
