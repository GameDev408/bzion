// SCSS Notes
// ----------
// - Comments made with '//' are meant for developers only, they will not appear when this SCSS is compiled to CSS so
//   feel free to use them to make notes
//
// - The style this SCSS file will follow is use the least classes as possible because the more classes there are, the
//   more HTML we have type or generate and it just looks ugly so simply create one parent CSS class and then use other
//   classes only if needed
//
// - There are general use CSS classes for easy access and universal settings such as floating items and padding
//
